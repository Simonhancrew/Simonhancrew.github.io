总结一下c++中存在的各类初始化问题, 傻逼c++居然有8种初始化的方式。

1. Default-initialization: zero-initialization
2. Zero-initialization: value-initialization, non-local initialization, constant-initialization
3. Value-initialization: aggregate-initialization, list-initialization, default-initialization, zero-initialization, copy-initialization
4. Aggregate-initialization: list-initialization, copy-initialization, direct-initialization
5. List-initialization: direct-list-initialization, copy-list-initialization, aggregate-initialization, copy-initialization, direct-initialization
6. Direct-initialization: list-initialization, aggregate-initialization, value-initialization, copy-initialization
7. Copy-initialization: list-initialization, aggregate-initialization, direct-initialization
8. Constant-initialization: default-initialization
9. Reference initialization: list-initialization, copy-initialization, direct-initialization
